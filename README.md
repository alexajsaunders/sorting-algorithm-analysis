# sorting-algorithm-analysis

This project develops a custom sorting method that sorts a stack of Integers using the two main operations of the stack. The run time of the algorithm is analyzed by sorting arrays of various lengths (10, 100, 1000, 1000, 100000) given as input files against a standard Quicksort algorithm. The customSort utilizes a helper stack to pop elements from the original stack onto the helper stack to maintain the the helper stack is always sorted. 

Classes:
- QuickSort
- Stack (fixed size array implementation)
- customSort
- Client/Main
